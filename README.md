# Compass Volunteer Flow â€“ Code Showcase

**A tool that makes helping others easier.**  
This is my frontend implementation of the Compass flow, developed for the non-profit organization noQ â€“ a step-by-step guide that helps volunteers find the right support services for people in need.

## About the Project

Volunteers often face information overload â€“ what services are available, who qualifies, how do you narrow things down?  
**Compass solves that with a structured flow:**  
**Start â†’ Service Type â†’ Age Group â†’ Filter â†’ Results.**

I built the entire frontend in React, including:
- Multi-step navigation (React Router v6)
- State management with Context API
- Dynamic filtering & text search
- API integration with query parameters

> Development started with mocked data to build and test logic. Once stable, I integrated the flow with noQâ€™s backend in production.
